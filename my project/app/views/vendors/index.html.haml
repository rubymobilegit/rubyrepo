        #business-bottom-h2 Stop wasting time on advertising.
        #business-bottom-text1
          Maybe you've heard the old adage: "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half." Maybe you even subscribe to this thinking.
          If so, maybe it's time to consider a new marketing model that doesn't include wasting money on fruitless advertising but focuses on consumers who declare their intent
          to buy your product or service.
        #business-bottom-h3 Muddleme introduces you to real time in market purchasers.
        #business-bottom-text2
          Muddleme redefines what's possible with your marketing budget. Whether you have $100 or $10.000.000 to spend, buyers on the Muddleme platform are incentivized
          to buy with cash rewards, coupons and our proprietary value score. Choose your customers with pin-point accuracy, or allow us to set up an automated campaign.
          Whatever you choose, you'll be working off the factual basis of a consumer's expressed intent to buy.
        #business-bottom-h4 Real opportunities to make a sale.
        #business-bottom-text3
          Simply having a website or buying keywors doesn't generate sales. In fact, sometimes they can be a deterrent when having to chose where to spend your money.
          The Muddleme platform increases conversion by revealing a user's real intent to buy via our Muddleme score, a patented, algorithm based rating of a buyer's probability to transact.
